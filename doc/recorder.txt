FEATURES                                    *recorder-nvim-recorder--features*

- **Simplified controls**One key to start and stop recording, a second key for playing the macro. Instead of `qa … q @a @@`, you just do `q … q Q Q`.
- **Macro Breakpoints** for easier debugging of macros. Breakpoints can also be set after the recording and are automatically ignored when triggering a macro with a count.
- **Status line components**Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0` where the recording status is not visible.
- **Macro-to-Mapping**Copy a macro in decoded form for mappings to your default register.
- **Various quality-of-life features**notifications with macro content, the ability to cancel a recording, a command to edit macros,
- **Performance Optimizations for large macros**When the macro is triggered with a high count, temporarily enable settings like |`lazyredraw`| during the macro.
- Uses up-to-date nvim features like `vim.ui.input` or `vim.notify`. This means you can get confirmation notices with plugins like nvim-notify <https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify>.
- Written 100% in lua. Lightweight (~300 LoC).


SETUP                                          *recorder-nvim-recorder--setup*


INSTALLATION ~

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        opts = {}, -- required even with default settings, since it calls `setup()`
        dependencies = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional dependency
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        config = function() require("recorder").setup() end,
        requires = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional dependency
    }
<

Calling `setup()` (or `lazy`’s `opts`) is **required**.

Using a notification plugin like nvim-notify
<https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify> is not necessary, but recommended.


CONFIGURATION ~

>lua
    -- default values
    require("recorder").setup {
        -- Named registers where macros are saved (single lowercase letters only).
        -- The first register is the default register used as macro-slot used after
        -- startup.
        slots = { "a", "b" },
    
        -- default keymaps
        mapping = {
            startStopRecording = "q",
            playMacro = "Q",
            switchSlot = "<C-q>",
            editMacro = "cq",
            yankMacro = "yq",
            addBreakPoint = "", --  this should be a string you don't use in insert mode during a macro
        },
    
        -- Clears all macros-slots on startup.
        clear = false,
    
        -- Log level used for any notification, mostly relevant for nvim-notify.
        -- (Note that by default, nvim-notify does not show the levels trace & debug.)
        logLevel = vim.log.levels.INFO,
    
        -- If enabled, only critical notifications are sent.
        -- If you do not use a plugin like nvim-notify, set this to `true`
        -- to remove otherwise annoying messages.
        lessNotifications = false,
    
        -- Enable nerdfont icons in the status bar components.
        useNerdfontIcons = true,
    
        -- Performance optimzations for macros with high count. When `playMacro` is
        -- triggered with a count higher than the threshold, nvim-recorder
        -- temporarily changes changes some settings for the duration of the macro.
        performanceOpts = {
            countThreshold = 200,
            lazyredraw = true, -- enable lazyredraw (see `:h lazyredraw`)
            noSystemClipboard = true, -- remove `+`/`` from clipboard option
            autocmdEventsIgnore = { -- temporarily ignore these autocmd events
                "TextChangedI",
                "TextChanged",
                "InsertLeave",
                "InsertEnter",
                "InsertCharPre",
            },
        }
    
        -- [experimental] partially share keymaps with nvim-dap.
        -- (See README for further explanations.)
        dapSharedKeymaps = false,
    }
<

If you want to handle multiple macros or use `cmdheight=0`, it is recommended
to also set up the status line components.


STATUS LINE COMPONENTS ~

>lua
    -- Indicates whether you are currently recording. Useful if you are using
    -- `cmdheight=0`, where recording-status is not visible.
    require("recorder").recordingStatus()
    
    -- Displays non-empty macro-slots (registers) and indicates the selected ones.
    -- Only displayed when not recording. Slots with breakpoints get an extra ``.
    --  use with the config `clear = true` to see recordings you made this session.
    require("recorder").displaySlots()
<

Example for adding the status line components to lualine
<https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim>

>lua
    lualine_y = {
        { require("recorder").displaySlots },
    },
    lualine_z = {
        { require("recorder").recordingStatus },
    },
    --  put the components in different status line segments so they have 
    -- a different color, making the recording status more distinguishable
<


USAGE                                          *recorder-nvim-recorder--usage*


BASICS ~

- `startStopRecording`Starts recording to the current macro slot (so you do not need to specify a register). Press again to end the recording.
- `playMacro`Plays the macro in the current slot (without the need to specify a register).
- `switchSlot`Cycles through the registers you specified in the configuration. Also show a notification with the slot and its content. (The currently selected slot can be seen in the |recorder-status-line-component|.)
- `editMacro`Edit the macro recorded in the active slot. (Be aware that these are the keystrokes in "encoded" form.)
- `yankMacro`Copies the current macro in decoded form that can be used to create a mapping from it. Breakpoints are removed from the macro.


  For recursive macros (playing a macro inside a macro), you can still use the
  default command `@a`.

MACRO BREAKPOINTS ~

`nvim-recorder` allows you to set breakpoints in your macros, which can be
helpful for debugging macros. Breakpoints are automatically ignored when you
trigger the macro with a count.

**Setting Breakpoints** 1. _During a recording,_ press the `addBreakPoint` key
(default: )in normal mode. 2. _After a recording,_ use `editMacro` and add or
remove the manually.

**Playing Macros with Breakpoints** - Using the `playMacro` key, the macro
automatically stops at the next breakpoint. The next time you press
`playMacro`, the next segment of the macro is played. - Starting a new
recording, editing a macro, yanking a macro, or switching macro slot all reset
the sequence, meaning that `playMacro` starts from the beginning again.


  You can do other things in between playing segments of the macro, like moving a
  few characters to the left or right. That way you can also use breakpoints to
  manually correct irregularities.
**Ignoring Breakpoints** When you play the macro with a _count_ (for example
`50Q`), breakpoints are automatically ignored.


  Add a count of 1 (`1Q`) to play a macro once and still ignore breakpoints.
**Shared Keybindings with nvim-dap** If you are using nvim-dap
<https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap>, you can use `dapSharedKeymaps =
true` to set up the following shared keybindings: 1. `addBreakPoint` maps to
`dap.toggle_breakpoint()` outside a recording. During a recording, it adds a
macro breakpoint instead. 2. `playMacro` maps to `dap.continue()` if there is
at least one dap-breakpoint. If there is no dap-breakpoint, plays the current
macro-slot instead.

Note that this feature is experimental, since the respective API from nvim-dap
is non-public and can be changed without deprecation notice
<https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/810#discussioncomment-4623606>.

economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
