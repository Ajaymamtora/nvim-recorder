FEATURES                                                   *recorder-features*


- Simplifies recording macros, especially for one-off macros. No need to remember the register where a macro has been saved to.
- Add |recorder-breakpoints-to-your-macros| for easier debugging of macros. Breakpoints can also be set after the recording, and are ignored when triggering a macro with a count.
- Status line components. Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0`.
- Some quality-of-life features like notifications with macro content, the ability to cancel a recording, or a command to edit macros.
- Uses up-to-date nvim features like `vim.ui.input` or `vim.notify`. This means you can get confirmation notices with plugins like nvim-notify <https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify>.
- Written 100% in lua. Lightweight wrapper (~250 LoC) around the built-in macro-feature.


SETUP                                                         *recorder-setup*

INSTALLATION ~

>
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        config = function() require("recorder").setup() end,
    }
    
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        config = function() require("recorder").setup() end,
    },
<


Calling `setup()` is **required**.

CONFIGURATION ~

>
    -- default values
    require("recorder").setup {
        -- Named registers where macros are saved. 
        -- First register is the default register/macro-slot used after startup. 
        -- Be aware that vim saves macros in registers, so using a register inside a 
        -- macro will cause trouble.
        slots = {"a", "b"},
    
        -- Default Mappings
        mapping = {
            startStopRecording = "q",
            playMacro = "Q",
            editMacro = "cq",
            switchSlot = "<C-q>",
            addBreakPoint = "#",
        }
    
        -- clear all macros on startup
        clear = false,
    
        -- log level used for any notification. Mostly relevant for nvim-notify. (Note that by default, nvim-notify only shows levels 2 and higher.)
        logLevel = vim.log.levels.INFO,
    
        -- (experimental) if true, nvim-recorder and dap will use shared keymaps:
        -- 1) `addBreakPoint` will map to `dap.toggle_breakpoint()` outside
        -- a recording. During a recording, it will add a macro breakpoint instead.
        -- 2) `playMacro` will map to `dap.continue()` if there is at least one
        -- dap-breakpoint. If there is no dap breakpoint, will play the current
        -- macro-slot instead
        dapSharedKeymaps = false,
    }

USAGE                                                         *recorder-usage*

BASICS ~


- `startStopRecording`: starts recording. Saves automatically to the current macro slot, so you do not need to specify a register. Press again to end the recording.
- `switchSlot`: cycles through the registers you specified in the configuration, and also show a notice with that macroâ€™s content.
- `editMacro`: lets you modify the macro recorded in the active slot.
- `playMacro`: plays the macro in the current slot, no need to specify a register.


MACRO BREAKPOINTS ~

_nvim-recorder_ allows you to set breakpoints in your macros which can be
helpful for debugging macros. Breakpoints are automatically ignored when you
trigger a macro with a count.

**Setting Breakpoints** 1. _During a recording_ press the `addBreakPoint` key
(default: `#`) in normal mode. 2. _After a recording_ use `editMacro` and add
(or remove) the `#` manually.

**Playing Macros with Breakpoints** Using the `playMacro` key, the macro
automatically stops at the next breakpoint. The next time you press
`playMacro`, the next segment of the macro is played.

Starting a new recording, editing a macro, or switching macro slot all reset
the sequence, meaning that `playMacro` starts from the beginning again.


  **Note** You can also do other things in between playing segments of the macro,
  like moving a few characters to the left or right. That way you can also use
  breakpoints to manually correct things.


**Ignoring Breakpoints** When you play the macro with a _count_ (for example
`50Q`), breakpoints are automatically ignored. _Tip_: add a count of 1 (`1Q`)
to play a macro once and ignore any breakpoints.

STATUS LINE COMPONENTS                       *recorder-status-line-components*

>
    -- indicates whether you are currently recording. Useful if you are using `cmdheight=0`, where recording-status is not visible.
    require("recorder").recordingStatus()
    
    -- displays non-empty macro-slots (registers) and indicates the selected ones. Only displayed when *not* recording. Slots with breakpoints get an extra `#`.
    -- Recommendation: use with the config `clear = true`
    require("recorder").displaySlots()
<


Example for adding the status line components to lualine
<https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim>:

>
    lualine_y = {
        { require("recorder").displaySlots },
    },
    lualine_z = {
        { require("recorder").recordingStatus },
    },

ABOUT ME                                                   *recorder-about-me*

In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in
